# Slack to WordPress

A quick WordPress plugin that will allow us to get interesting content from Slack into WordPress (and eventually other social platforms)

Create a "Slack App" and enable the "Interactive Comonent" feature, then set the callback URL to `https://your-wp-website.com/wp-json/dtbaker-slack-social/v1/submit`
